          You might have heard about the Māori ‘tattoo’ culture, which is called
          Tā Moko and is seen as a cultural treasure.<mark><i>Tā moko</i></mark>
          is a unique expression of cultural heritage and identity through
          tattoos.Its genesis is in New Zealand.

        <p>
          Tā moko reflects an individual's whakapapa (ancestry) and personal
          history. In earlier times, it was an important signifier of social
          rank, knowledge, skill and eligibility to marry. Many of the design
          motifs are universal especially applied to the ihu,cheek,lower jaws
          and the curvilinear rays on the forehead and from the nose to
          mouth.The remaining elements were carefully chosen to accentuate and
          enhance the individual features, giving meaning to the expression
          Mataora, the living face.The main lines of Tā moko are called
          <i><strong>manawi</strong></i>
          ;heart, which represent an individuals life journey.Each moko was
          meant to make the wearer more fierce in battle and more attractive to
          the opposite sex. Receiving a moko is a big honor, and the only people
          without moko were slaves or workers. Because of their uniqueness, moko
          were also used in the 19th century to sign official documents; by
          drawing it in place of a signature.

            <h3>The Art</h3>
          </header>]
          <p>
            At first Tā moko involved the use of broad toothed combs of varying
            widths called <i><strong>uhi,chisel blades.</strong></i>
            The blades were dipped in dark pigment, and struck into the skin
            with small mallets known as tā.Burnt wood was used to create black
            pigments whereas lighter pigments were derived from caterpillars
            infected with a certain type of fungus or burnt kauri gum mixed with
            animal fat.the art is a form of scarification similar to wood
            carving as deep furrow grooves were left on the skin.Traditionally,
            it is applied to the back, buttocks, legs and to the face. Because
            the head is considered the most sacred part of the body, a facial
            moko is the ultimate statement of the wearer’s identity. For women,
            a moko kauae, a moko on the chin is also very popular.

            <p>
              In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century metals replaced bone in the
              manufacture of uhi,tattoing chisels and combs.Adoption of needle
              tattooing during late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup

              >
              century revolutionized Tā moko and until today is the most
              obiquitous method of tattooing used globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite being revitalised in recent timings by various artists and
              being both respected and accepted largely as a culture that should
              be conserved and preserved over generations to come,Tā moko faced
              a threat of extinction due to colonisation and adoption of
              Christianity in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century.Missionaries and
              Pākehā(European New Zealanders) thought it distasteful even while
              being somewhat fascinated by it.Young men were more affected by
              this than women.
