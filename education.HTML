    <h1><b>Education</b></h1>
    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>
      The term "education" was coined from the latin word "educo" meaning to
      educe,to draw out,to develop from within.Philosophers such as Socrates and
      authors like Napoleon Hill have described education as developing through
      the law of use.Knowledge is power is too trite for the more advanced and
      evolved world.Used knowledge ,arguably,is indeed power.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Evolution of Education</u></h2>
    <p>
      Education has changed drastically over the years.From passing on
      information to younger generations through word of mouth disregarging the
      place,apprenticeship and finally switching to formal education which takes
      place in learning institutions.The term "school" was coined from the Greek
      word "schole" meaning leisure.This gives an idea of how education was
      perceived back then.Perhaps as an interesting and enjoyable activity
      contraty to recent times where it is a neccessity.Whether it is still
      enjoyable or not is down to individual perception.From logograms
      representing whole words to letters used as components making up words.

    <h2><u>Types of Education</u></h2>
    <h3><i>Formal Education</i></h3>
    <p>
      It is the kind of learning that takes place in official settings i.e
      learning institutions such as universities and is often governed by set
      rules and regulations.Formal education back then was restricted to both
      gender and status i.e only the royal offsprings and sons of wealthy
      professionals such as physicians could access education.Currently,in most
      parts of the world formal education is available for both genders.
    </p>
    <h3><i>Informal Education</i></h3>
    <p>
      It is the type of learning that takes place outside the official setting
      and is not governed by set rules and regulations.Back then boys would
      accompany their fathers and through apprenticeship learn their
      trades.Girls on the other hand would stay back at home with their mothers
      where they would get educated on handling domestic chores such as
      housekeeping,cleaning and taking care of young children.Informal education
      in general has become less common over the years only to be practised
      mostly in the less advanced parts of the globe.
    </p>
    <h3><i>Non-formal Education</i></h3>
    <p>
      Non-formal learning includes various structured learning situations which
      do not either have the level of curriculum, syllabus, accreditation and
      certification associated with 'formal learning', but have more structure
      than that associated with 'informal learning', which typically take place
      naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Importance of Education</u></h2>
    <p>
      The importance of education can not be stressed enough.It is not only
      beneficial at personal level but also at societal level.Along with
      acquiring income earning skills and satisfying self in whatever
      way,individuals in the society are able to develop interpersonal skills
      which improve the quality of interactions amongst themselves.Proper
      education is also a tool used to eliminate certain
      stereotypes,misconceptions and practices that bring more harm than good.A
      literate environment which is necessary for smooth daily operations is
      also created through education.
